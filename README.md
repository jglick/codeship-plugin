# codeship-plugin

You like [CodeShip](https://codeship.com/), maybe already using it, but want|have to run on Jenkins _on-premises_ ?

This plugin translates `codeship-steps.yml` into a Jenkins pipeline on the fly, so you can keep your existing pipeline 
and just get it to run without changes on Jenkins 2.x.
